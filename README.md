# **Drosophila Y-Linked Exon Sequencing Bias Analysis**

This repository contains supplementary files for the study **"Strong sequencing bias in Nanopore and PacBio prevents assembly of Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked genes."** The study investigates sequencing biases affecting the assembly of Y-linked exons in *Drosophila melanogaster* using **Nanopore, PacBio, and Illumina** technologies.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into three main directories:

### **Fasta/** – Assembled Contigs and Reference Sequences  
This directory contains FASTA files with assembled "missing exons" and reference sequences used in the study. Reference sequences include Y-linked exons and satellite DNA.

### **Scripts/** – Data Processing and Analysis Scripts  
This directory includes **Python, AWK, and Shell scripts** used for read coverage computation, statistical tests, and visualization. 

### **Data/** – Processed Data for Figures and Tables  
This directory contains **tabulated data** used in figures and statistical tests presented in the manuscript.
